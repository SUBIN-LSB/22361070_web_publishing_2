                <p>Breaking news. An unbelievable incident has occurred at a Napoli Family Restaurant that has been bustling since its grand opening.</p>
                <p>Whether it’s because no one believes it or due to someone’s conspiracy, I, reporter Lee, have worked tirelessly to get permission</p>
                <p>to publish this incredible big news in the newspaper. After about 22 failed attempts, I finally got the chance to write about this incident.</p>
                <p>The more you try to find this pasta restaurant, the harder it is to locate, and when you least expect it, it suddenly appears.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>The unbelievable, or rather, hard-to-believe big news is that a total of five people have gone missing from this restaurant.</p>
                <p>These five missing individuals were all from one family: two siblings and three pet cats. We are currently distributing flyers about them.</p>
                <p>If you see these flyers or if anyone has spotted them, please do not tell anyone and instead contact me directly.</p>
                <p>Remember, this is the best course of action for everyone involved.</p>

        <h2 style='letter-spacing:2rem'>- WHERE ARE THEY -</h2>
        <p>Where could they all have gone? If you have any information, please contact me.</p>
        <div class="bottom-text">
            <p>The first missing person is an adult male, the oldest among them. He has short hair and wears braces, and he has a younger sister.</p>
            <p>The second missing person is an adult woman, the second oldest among them. She has long, light-colored hair and appears tired.</p>
            <p>The third missing individual is their first cat. It is the second oldest among all the cats, chubby, lazy, and enjoys eating.</p>
            <p>The fourth missing individual is their second cat. It is the oldest among all the cats and has poor teeth, making it difficult for it to eat.</p>
            <p>The last, fifth missing individual is their youngest cat, and among all the cats, it is the youngest. It resembles a tiger in appearance and is active.</p>
